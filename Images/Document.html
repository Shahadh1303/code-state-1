    <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
    <p>Ever since Charles Babbage's difference engine in 1822,computer have required a medim of instructing them to perform a specific task.This medium is known as programming language.Computer languages were first composed of a series of steps to write a particlar program.These are morphed into a series of steps keyed into the computer and then executed </p>
    <br>
    <p>Computer programming began on a large scale during 1960's.Programming can be done using many languages.These languages are broadly classified into 3 types :
        <ul>
            <li>
                Machine Languages
            </li>
            <li>
                Assembly Languages
            </li>
            <li>
                High Level Languages
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What is Programming</h2>
    <p> Programming is where we generally mean the craft of structuring instructions of code, written using a programming language, in order to create a working program.        
        Programming is solving problems. And as such, programming starts way, way earlier than the time you reach for the keyboard and you start to type instructions on the computer.
        Programming starts when you are thinking about the problem. Or the app.
        Programming is when you are gathering the requirements, talking to all the people involved in the app, talking to the clients, analyzing all the different things that the app should do.
        Programming is defining what the app should not do.
        Programming is determining if your app is impossible or too costly to run, even before you start working on it.
        Programming is drawing all the flow diagrams to help you solve a problem.
        Programming is also when you are stuck and you need to solve a problem. How to search for answers on Google and how to ask a good question is a skill on its own.
        In the end, 70% of programming is done outside of your code editor.</p>
